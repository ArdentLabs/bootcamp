Week 1: Hello World :wave:
==========================
 > `console.log('Hello World');`

## Course background and goals

This course is a jump into the deep end of mobile app development. Everything you learn in this class will be applicable to the real world, in a real job. Expectations for you will be high. Read the required resources that we give you, especially in the first few weeks. If you feel that you are falling behind, **please talk to us**. There will be several opportunities for acquiring additional assistance; you will find office hours and code reviews to be most helpful.

In addition to the amount of work, instructors will be strict on the way you write your code. Clean, reusable code is an essence of programming excellence and a main determining factor between a good and bad software engineer. Code reviews will also serve as instructors' way to find any stylistic hiccups and assess the structural integrity of your design.


## Communication and coordination
 > It is not distance that keeps people apart, but the lack of communication.

Every tool that we will use during this bootcamp are tools that you would use on the job. It's important that you use these tools actively; however, it's even more important to understand how to communicate effectively with your team and instructors. You will receive an effective communication evaluation at the end of the course.


### Slack

Throughout the length of the course, we will be using Slack to communicate. If you followed Week 0's instructions, you should have received an email invitation already. You will be using Slack to communicate with your classmates, team members (if you have any), and instructors. If you have a question or comment relating to the course, send a message on the `#bootcamp` channel. If you want to schedule office hours, send a direct message to `@puradox`. If you're on a team, one of the instructors will create a private channel for your team.

[Download the Slack App](https://slack.com/get) on your phone and laptop to receive notifications.


### Trello
 > Organize your project into cards.

Trello is a card-based project management application that allows developers to plan their project from start to finish. This is a great way to communicate in a team by letting them know what features you have planned out. Team coordination is also simplified by utilizing card assignment to assign members to work on different features.

You will be creating a Trello board for your project, before any code has been created. Instructors will be constantly reviewing your project's Trello board to assess your progress. It is important that you use this tool while developing your application, from start to finish. This becomes immensely more important when working on a team, since features will be coordinated through Trello.

## Development workflow

All of the development tools that we'll be using will be command-line based. Thus, using the command line will be an integral part of the course. The commands that I'll be going over this week assumes that you're on a Linux or Mac machine. Instructors will be primarily using Mac for development, so it's highly recommended that you acquire a Mac.

 > Note: Windows does things a little differently. For this reason, you might have trouble following along with the notes. Again, I recommend using either Mac or Linux for development. Alternatively, you can have a Linux environment on Windows through the [Bash on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) project. If Bash on Windows isn't working out for you, as a last resort, [create a virtual machine that runs Ubuntu](https://linus.nci.nih.gov/bdge/installUbuntu.html).

### Working in the command line
