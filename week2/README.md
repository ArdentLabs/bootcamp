# Week 2: Going Native

Congratulations on surviving week one and learning our basic cli programs,
`npm`, `yarn`, and `create-react-native-app`! Before we continue with
[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), let's learn a few
things about JavaScript, JSX, React's component design, and error parsing to
help us along the way.

## Basic JavaScript

There are a number of topics discussed in
[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net), and they are summarized
here to make your life easier. Please also read through the book if you have
enough time to do so.

### Types

There are just a few types we'll want to focus on in JavaScript, namely numbers,
strings, and booleans.

__**Numbers**__ are represented as you might expect:
```
8
8.16
8.332e8
/* Just like many calculators, we represent 833,200,000 with compact exponential
form 8.332e8. */
```

__**Strings**__ are represented in a similar way to other languages:
```
/* These two strings are identical */
"Hello World!"
'Hello World!'
```
We can also use a set of *escape characters* for special functions:
```
"This is the first line\nAnd this is the second"
/* Displays as */
This is the first line
And this is the second
```
Here are some common escape characters:

Escape Character | Output
---------------- | -----------
`\'`             | Single Quote
`\"`             | Double Quote
`\\`             | Backslash
`\r`             | Carriage Return
`\b`             | Backspace
`\f`             | Form Feed
`\t`             | Horizontal Tabulator
`\v`             | Vertical Tabulator

Only the first four of these make sense for our usage, so don't worry about the
others.

__**Booleans**__ can hold just two values: true or false.

### Operators

There are three main categories of operators in JavaScript, the first of which
are Arithmetic operators. These are used to perform mathematic operations which
return a number based on the operation they perform.

Operator | Operation Performed
-------- | -----------------------
`+`      | Addition (`6 + 3` returns `9`)
`-`      | Subtraction (`6 - 3` returns `3`)
`/`      | Division (`6 / 3` returns `2`)
`*`      | Multiplication (`6 * 3` returns `18`)
`%`      | Modulus (Think of this as remainder, `6 % 3` returns `0`)
`**`     | Exponentiation (`6 ** 3` is `6 * 6 * 6`, which returns `216`)
`++`     | Increment (`++1` returns `2`, `++2` returns `3`, and so on)
`--`     | Decrement (`--5` returns `4`, `--4` returns `3`, and so on)

Comparison operators are used to determine differences between objects. They
return boolean values, and use the operators listed below.

Operator | Operation Performed
-------- | -----------------------
`==`     | Equality (`5 == 5` returns `true` and `5 == '5'` also returns `true`)
`===`    | Strict Equality (`5 === 5` returns `true` but `5 === '5'` returns `false`)
`!=`     | Inequality (`4 != 5` returns `true` but `5 != '5'` returns `false`)
`!==`    | Strict Inequality (`4 !== 5` returns `true` and `5 !== '5'` returns `true`)
`>`      | Greater Than (`5 > 3` returns `true` but `5 > 5` returns `false`)
`>=`     | Greater Than or Equal To (`5 >= 3` returns `true` and `5 >= 5` returns `true`)
`<`      | Less Than (`3 < 7` returns `true` but `7 < 7` returns `false`)
`<=`     | Less Than or Equal To (`3 <= 7` returns `true` and `7 <= 7` returns `true`)

Logical operators determine relationships involving one or two boolean objects.
They also return boolean values.

Operator | Operation Performed
-------- | -----------------------
`&&`     | Logical AND: Returns true only if both objects are true (`true && true` returns `true`)
`||`     | Logical OR:  Returns false only if both objects are false (`false || false` returns `false`)
`!`      | Logical NOT: Returns the opposite of what it is passed (`!false` returns `true`)

### Variables

We will be discussing two types of variables in JavaScript: `let`s and `const`s.

A `let` should be your default choice if you want to change the value of the
variable later. Here is an example executed in the console using a `let`:
```
Ardents-iMac:~ ardentlabs$ node
> let myVariable = 'spaghetti and meatballs'
undefined
> myVariable
'spaghetti and meatballs'
> 'I love ' + myVariable + '.'
'I love spaghetti and meatballs.'
> myVariable = 'pizza'
'pizza'
> 'I love ' + myVariable + '.'
'I love pizza.'
```

A `const` variable should be your choice if you wish to never change the value
you store inside of it. Example:
```
Ardents-iMac:~ ardentlabs$ node
> const cannotChangeThis = 'I want a pony!'
undefined
> cannotChangeThis
'I want a pony!'
> cannotChangeThis = 'I want an ocelot!'
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

To be aware of the shortcomings of the `const` variable type, let's see one more
example:
```
> Ardents-iMac:~ ardentlabs$ clear
Ardents-iMac:~ ardentlabs$ node
> const shouldNotChange = { favoriteAnimal: 'puppy' }
undefined
> shouldNotChange.favoriteAnimal
'puppy'
> shouldNotChange.favoriteAnimal = 'kitten'
'kitten'
> shouldNotChange.favoriteAnimal
'kitten'
```
We see that, despite being stored in a `const` variable, we are able to change
an element of the object `shouldNotChange`. This is because we are simply
modifying one of the children of `shouldNotChange` instead of modifying the
object itself. Be aware of this when designing your apps!

Scoping is another important aspect of variable usage. To reason out why, let's
ask a simple question: If we create a variable, when is it deleted?

The answer depends on where we create the variable in our code. Consider the
project outline below:
```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

const variable1 = 'one';

class App extends Component {
  const variable2 = 'two';

  constructor() {
    super();
    const variable3 = 'three';
  }

  myFunction = () => {
    const variable4 = 'four';
  }
}
```
Now let's break down when each variable comes into and goes out of scope
(thereby being deleted):

1. This variable is declared independently of any scope, and will therefore
come into existence when the application is launched. It will not be deleted
from memory until the application is closed. This is called a global variable,
and we want to use as few of these as possible for security reasons. It is
accessed from anywhere in this file by its name, `variable1`.
2. This variable is declared within the object and will be created and deleted
with the class. Declaring variables here is not encouraged, as it is only
supported by newer code specifications (â‰¥ ES6), but if you do use it, **AND
DO NOT USE IT**, it is accessed using `this.variable2`
3. This variable has the same scope as variable 2, which is created and deleted
when the class is created and deleted. This is called an instance variable, and
we will need to access it using `this.variable3`.
4. This variable is declared within myFunction, and will be created once
myFunction is called and deleted when myFunction completes (or returns). Since
it can only be accessed from inside of myFunction, it will always be called
`variable4`.
